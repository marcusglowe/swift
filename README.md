# apple/swift/vim duplicate

This package automatically pulls in changes to Apple's swift vim plugin to the root, so that it can be installed without first downloading the plugin locally and referencing it in your vim config

Instead, you can use:
```
Plugin 'marcusglowe/vim-swift'
```
or however you install plugins

Auto-updated once a day through a github action
